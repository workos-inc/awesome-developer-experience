DX describes the experience developers have when they use your product, be it client libraries, SDKs, frameworks, open source code, tools, API, technology or service. DX shares some ideas and philosophies from UX design (or HCI), but builds on these with an eye towards modern technology and standards. | Sam Jarman        | 10/6/2017  | API Producers                        |
| [Building a Developer Experience Team at Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/scaling-product-management-at-sendgrid-building-a-developer-experience-team)     | As we scaled up to hundreds of employees, many new PMs, designers, and engineers ended up working on the product who didn’t share that same explicit understanding of our developer customers. Slowly, but surely, the overall DX around SendGrid suffered.                                                                                                                                                                                | Scott Williamson  | 4/12/2017  | API Producers (Engineering Managers) |

It can help increase programmers’ efficience and make it easier for developers to achieve goals on behalf of end users.                                                                                                                                                         | Sergio De Simone  | 10/25/2015 | API Producers                        |

Its features satisfied basic needs and also inspired ideas of what could be done when the Internet was always in your pocket. Eight months later, Apple made the iOS SDK available, transforming the iPhone from a product into a platform.                                                                                                           | Jeremiah Lee      | 3/24/2011  | Platform Producers                   |
